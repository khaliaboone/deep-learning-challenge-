Alphabet Soup Charity: Predicting Funding Success
This project uses deep learning to predict whether an organization applying for funding from Alphabet Soup will be successful. The dataset includes various features about past applicants, such as application type, income, and organization classification. After cleaning the data (removing unnecessary columns, handling rare categories, and converting categorical data into numeric values), we trained a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify whether an organizationâ€™s application was successful.

The model was trained on this preprocessed data, and after tuning the architecture, it was saved in HDF5 format for future use. You can reload the model at any time to make predictions on new data. The goal of this project was to create a tool that can predict funding success based on past application data, helping Alphabet Soup make more informed decisions.

I was able to create this read me file as well as get help creating my code with help from ChatGPT. I also applied prior knowledge from other assignments.
